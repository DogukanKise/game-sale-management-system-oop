Game Management system with OOP Java
You want to write a game. We plan to develop backend codes for this software with JAVA. New members, sales and campaign management are requested. You can export the properties of objects as you like. The purpose here is the quality of the code you are writing. It doesn't matter to me if you don't fully understand the requirements in the homework, you can develop logic for yourself. As I said, we are interested in code quality right now :)



Requirements

1. Simulate an environment where players can register in the system, update their information, delete their records. We want to verify the accuracy of customer information using e-government systems. (Verification in e-government systems is done with the information of TcNo, First Name, Last name, Birth year. You just need to simulate the service that will do this.) (Such as logging)

2. Simulate the sales environment in which the game can be sold.( Sales made must be associated with the player. I mean that the player is in the method as a parameter.)

3. Simulate the possibility of entering a new campaign into the system, deleting the campaign, and updating it.

4. Simulate campaign integration in sales.
